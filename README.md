# ECEN-CAPSTONE-DAST
404 capstone dual axis solar tracker MCU subsystem

Goals:
The MCU subsystem is responsible for the acquisition of photosensory data, which is fed in to a microcontroller (Arduino Uno Rev 3), and taken as input by the code to process and generate motor controller instructions to position the solar tracker mechanism in the optimum orientation for maximum sunlight coverage.
The subsystem can be broadly divided into three distinct phases. Acquisition of sensory data, data processing, and motor control movement.

Accomplished:
The LDR's were succesfully set up for data acquisition (DAST DATA); The code to move motors based on instructions for motor movement were also successful (DAST.INO). A successful PCB motor driver was designed as well but faced some soldering issues.
