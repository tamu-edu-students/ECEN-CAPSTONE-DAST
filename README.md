#Load subsystem - Cooper Hamlin

The goal of the Load subsystem was to convert a roughly 17.5V output from the Solar Panel to 14.7V through the use of a buck-boost converter that would charge a battery. Additionally, design a way to turn off battery charging once the battery was sufficiently charged through the use of a mosfet controlled switch. I spent roughly half my time designing and building my pcb and an incredible amount of time constructing the physical project including all of the cutting, sawing, gluing, screwing, drilling, etc.
