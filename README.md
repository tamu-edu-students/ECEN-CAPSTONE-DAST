#GUI Subsystem - Alexandra Torres

Overview: The goal of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) is to output sensor data in a dashboard-format website. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) subsystem consisted a website and an ESP32 WROOM module, which integrated with each other to enable users to analyze and monitor data from three sensors: an INA219 current sensor, an ADC voltage sensor, and an MPU6050 gyroscope sensor.
